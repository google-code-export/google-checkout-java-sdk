Building requires Maven.

To build a package:
  $ mvn package

Look in target for the built jar file.

To work on the project in Eclipse, either install a Maven plugin in
Eclipse, or run the following from the command line:
  $ mvn eclipse:eclipse

This will create the eclipse configs, and you can then import the
project into your Eclipse workspace.
