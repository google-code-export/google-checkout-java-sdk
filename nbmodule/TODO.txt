Master TODO list:

1. Find a way to add checkout-sdk.jar to the project's classpath during
integration.  Currently the user must run the Integration Wizard, then close
and reopen the project for netbeans to recognize the jar and automatically add
it.


2. Move hardcoded values into a easily updated config file or class with static
fields.

3. Add listeners to enable/disable the next button in the Checkout Integration
Wizard panels, only allowing the user to continue if the panel is in a valid
state (basically just error checking).

Select Project Panel (ProjectWizardPanel.java:303)
Only allow next when a project is selected and the text in the WEB-INF selector
is a valid directory.

Modify Web.xml Panel (WebXmlWizardPanel.java:320)
Only allow next when a web.xml file was found, or a file was not found but the
checkbox is selected.

Config File Panel (ConfigWizardPanel.java:247)
Only allow next when all fields have text entered.

Add Samples Panel (SamplesWizardPanel.java:231)
Only allow next if samples is unchecked, or samples is checked and the
location is a valid directory


4. There are a few places where I created a method that returns true or false
to indicate success, but this should probably be handled by throwing custom
exceptions.  The best example of this is Integrator.java, which could use
these custom exceptions to generate error messages for the user. 
(Integrator.java:162)

5. Look into getting the module signed, for ease of installation.
NOTE: The version must be increased to allow users to update the modules
through netbeans.  This can be done by right-clicking on the project
("Google Checkout SDK Integration") and selecting Properties and updating
the "Specification Version" number in the "API Versioning" node.

6. Enable help buttons throughout the Wizard panels.

7. Show some type of warning if you are running the Integration Wizard on
a project that has already been integrated (contains a checkout-config.xml
file).
